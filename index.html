    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        With over 30 years in the infrastructure sector, I’ve dedicated my career to pushing boundaries in technology, driving customer success, and pushing a spirit of entrepreneurship. As CEO of Bidcurement and VP of Technology at Maze of Life, I lead efforts to create unconventional solutions across infrastructure, procurement, operations, and mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
        My passion lies in integrating cutting-edge tech like AI, adaptive learning, and emotion analysis to build platforms that empower organizations and individuals alike. By bridging technology and human development, my goal is to help communities and businesses thrive in today’s fast-changing world.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a father of five and husband to Christina Roberson-Smeltzer, I value personal growth and balance. Through my podcasts, <em>The Infrastructure Hot Seat</em> and <em>The Infrastructure Network</em>, I connect with leaders, experts, and innovators, sparking conversations around tech, workforce development, and mental health. I’m committed to advancing the future of infrastructure and creating opportunities for people’s growth and transition.
