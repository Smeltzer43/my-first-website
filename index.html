    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        With over 30 years of experience in the infrastructure sector, I have dedicated my career to pioneering innovative technologies, driving customer success, and championing entrepreneurship. I strive to create services that optimize organizational efficiency while also supporting individuals through lifeâ€™s transitions. As the CEO of Bidcurement and VP of Technology at Maze of Life, I lead efforts to develop untraditional solutions in public infrastructure, procurement, operations, and mental health. 

        Iâ€™m passionate about integrating advanced technologies like AI, cognitive adaptive learning, and emotion analysis into platforms that enhance organizational performance and provide individuals with resources to grow and thrive. My vision is to bridge the gap between technology and human development by building systems that support both professional and personal needs, helping communities and businesses flourish in a fast-evolving world.

        As a father of five and happily married to Christina Roberson-Smeltzer, I understand the importance of balance and growth on a personal level. Through my podcasts, *The Infrastructure Hot Seat* and *The Infrastructure Network*, I connect with government leaders, industry experts, and innovators to bring forward meaningful conversations around technology, workforce development, and mental health. I am committed to driving the future of infrastructure and organizational optimization while facilitating opportunities for growth and transition in peopleâ€™s lives.
